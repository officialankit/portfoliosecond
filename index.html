            <p class="service-back-desc">A front end web developer is the person who implements web designs through coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though it’s not as common anymore, front end developers are/were sometimes called “client-side developers” to distinguish them from back end developers who program what goes on behind the scenes like databases. If you head to any site, you can see the work of a front end developer everywhere—in the navigation, layouts including this article page, even the way that a site looks different from your phone</p>

            <p class="service-back-desc">Branding is the characteristics that give your company a personality, a voice, and unique attributes that set you apart from other companies. As it pertains to website design, great branding will effectively master a look, feel, aesthetic, and messaging that tells your customer who you are and why you deserve to work with them.<br>

The companies that build these types of websites don’t always need a massive budget because of two reasons: they know who their customer is and they want to help them solve their problems.<br>


Here are a few of my favorite branding and website design examples from companies who do this exceptionally well.</p>
